Cluster Text
============

A Vim-plugin that allows you to write the most basic form of cluster texts based
on the work of Andreas PÃ¥lsson.     The basic rules are as follows:

- Following a full stop five (5) spaces are used instead of one (1)
- Alone words at the end of a line are wrapped to the next line
- Lines should be left aligned (not justified)
- 80-90 characters per line

The full rule set is complex and involves human judgement to place the indentations
within sentences.     As such, there is no simple algorythm (yet) that can be used
to place indentations while still maintaining a natural "feel" when reading the text.
