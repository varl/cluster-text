Cluster Text
============

A Vim-plugin that allows you to write the most basic form of cluster texts based
on the work of Andreas PÃ¥lsson.     The basic rules are as follows:

- Following a full stop five (5) spaces are used instead of one (1)
- Alone words at the end of a line are wrapped to the next line
- Lines should be left aligned (not justified)
- 80-90 characters per line

The full rule set is complex and involves human judgement to place the
indentations within sentences.     As such, there is no simple algorythm (yet)
that can be used to place indentations while still maintaining a natural "feel"
when reading the text.

The plugin works as such.     As you strike full-stop ('.') followed by a space
in reasonably rapid succession (one second or so) 5 spaces are inserted instead
of one.     There is some syntax highlighting as well.     Most prominently (and
perhaps incorrectly so) on the '.' character.

Other dividers, like comma, can be nice to cluster and has the same time-delay
as full-stops or exclamation/question marks.
